# 3D Portfolio

This project is a 3D portfolio website built with Three.js. <br/>
It was inspired by another developer's project and serves as a learning exercise to understand and implement 3D web visualizations.

## Project Overview

The portfolio showcases various projects and skills in an interactive 3D environment. <br/>
Users can navigate through the 3D space to explore different aspects of the portfolio.
